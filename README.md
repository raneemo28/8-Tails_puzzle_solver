# 8-Tails_puzzle_solver

a c# implementation of a 8-Tails puzzle solver using object oriented concepts and A* algorithem using sum of manhattan distances between each tail and its original place as a huristic
#### input:
text file eg. input.txt including the start state eg. <br>
234<br>
156<br>
 78<br>

#### output:
- the start state 
- the goal state
- a list of moves that the user should implement on the blank tail to solve the puzzle
- total number of moves that the user should  implement on the blank tail to solve the puzzle
  eg : <br>
Starting Puzzle State: <br>
1 2 3<br>
4 5 6<br>
7   8<br>
